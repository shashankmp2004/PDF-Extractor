PDF Outline Extractor
This project is a high-performance document analysis tool designed to extract the hierarchical structure (Title, H1, H2, H3) from PDF files. The final output is a clean, structured JSON file for each input document.

The core of this project is to build a smart, rule-based heuristic engine that analyzes various text properties to understand document structure without relying solely on a single attribute like font size.

üöÄ Project Roadmap & Implementation Plan
This project is broken down into distinct phases, from setup to optimization.

Phase 1: Environment Setup & Foundation
The first step is to create a robust and reproducible environment using Docker and establish the basic project structure.

1.1. Docker Configuration: Create a Dockerfile to set up the Python 3.9 environment. This will handle all dependencies and ensure the application runs consistently.

Dockerfile

FROM --platform=linux/amd64 python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
CMD ["python", "extract_outline.py"]
1.2. Dependencies: Create a requirements.txt file. This will contain the necessary Python libraries.

1.3. Project Structure: Organize the project into the expected directory structure to keep the code clean and modular.

Phase 2: Core PDF Data Extraction
This phase focuses on reading PDF files and extracting not just the text, but the rich metadata needed for analysis.

2.1. Text & Metadata Extraction: Use the chosen library to iterate through each page of a PDF. For every block of text, extract:

The text content.

Font size.

Font name (e.g., "Arial-BoldMT", which indicates weight).

Bounding box coordinates (for identifying indentation and centering).

2.2. Data Structuring: Store this extracted information in a clean, accessible format, such as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a text block and its properties.

Phase 3: The Heuristic Analysis Engine
This is the most critical phase. Here, we build the "brain" of the extractor in utils/analysis.py.

3.1. Baseline Calculation: Before classifying, first parse the entire document to find the most common font size and style. This establishes a "body text" baseline.

3.2. Feature Engineering: Develop a function that scores each text block based on a combination of signals. The key is to look for deviations from the body text baseline. Important features include:

Font Size & Weight: How much larger and bolder is the text than the baseline?

Numbering Patterns: Use re.compile() for efficient regex matching of patterns like 1., 1.1, Chapter 1, Section A.

Text Case: Is the text in ALL CAPS?.

Positional Cues: Is the text centered? Does it have significant empty space above and below it?.

Phase 4: Hierarchy Classification & Output
With the analysis engine built, this phase classifies the scored text blocks and builds the final JSON structure.

4.1. Title Detection: Implement a specific function to find the title, which is typically the text with the highest "heading score" on the first page.

4.2. Heading Clustering: Identify all text blocks that pass a certain heading score threshold. Group these potential headings into clusters based on their shared properties (e.g., all 18pt bold text).

4.3. Level Assignment (H1/H2/H3): Sort the clusters by prominence (usually font size). Assign the top cluster as H1, the next as H2, and so on. Use detected numbering patterns (e.g., a 2.1 pattern) to override and confirm heading levels for maximum accuracy.

4.4. JSON Generation: Assemble the title and the hierarchical outline into the final JSON structure as specified in the project requirements.

Phase 5: Performance & Finalization
The final phase focuses on meeting the strict performance targets and handling bonus requirements.

5.1. Parallel Processing: The challenge specifies running in a multi-core environment. Use Python's multiprocessing library to process multiple PDF files in the /app/input/ directory simultaneously, dramatically reducing total runtime.

5.2. Bonus - Multilingual Support: Enhance the regex patterns and heuristic engine to correctly identify headings in Japanese documents, which use different numbering conventions and cues.

5.3. Testing: Rigorously test the entire system with simple, complex, and edge-case PDFs to ensure robustness.
